# Data Structures in Swift.

# Overview
This repository contains implementations of various data structures using the Swift programming language. While these problems are commonly solved in languages like C, C++, Java and python this project aims to provide Swift-based solutions for developers working in Apple's ecosystem.

# Why Swift?
    •    Modern and expressive: Swift offers a clean, concise syntax that makes code more readable and maintainable.
    •    Safety features: Swift's strong typing and error handling capabilities help prevent common programming mistakes.
    •    Performance: Swift is designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for implementing data structures and algorithms.
    •    Growing popularity: As Swift continues to gain traction in iOS, macOS, and server-side development, having Swift implementations of common data structures becomes increasingly valuable.

# Problem Sources
The problems solved in this repository are sourced from popular coding platforms, including:
 LeetCode
 HackerRank

These platforms offer a wide range of data structure and algorithm challenges that help improve coding skills and understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.
